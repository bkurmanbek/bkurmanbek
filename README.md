Greeting! I am Bakytzhan, a talented and ambitious individual driven by my passion for mathematics and machine learning. Currently, I am pursuing my Master's degree in Mathematics at the esteemed University of British Columbia (UBC), where I have honed my skills and expanded my knowledge in these fields.

With a strong interest in super-resolution imaging, deep learning, and mathematics, I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate and grow in these areas. If you share my passion and vision, I would love to hear from you and explore potential partnerships.
